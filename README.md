📧 Spam Mail Classifier
=======================

📋 Overview
-----------

This project uses machine learning techniques to classify emails as either **spam** or **ham** (non-spam). It provides an easy-to-use interface powered by _Streamlit_, where users can input email content and instantly receive predictions.

🎯 Objective
------------

The goal is to detect spam emails with high accuracy using _TF-IDF vectorization_ and _logistic regression_. This tool helps users quickly determine if an email is spam, improving productivity and reducing the risk of phishing attacks.

🔍 Methodology
--------------

*   📝 **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts email text into numerical features suitable for machine learning.
*   📊 **Logistic Regression**: A classification algorithm used to distinguish between spam and ham emails.
*   🌐 **Streamlit App**: Provides a web interface for users to input text and view predictions in real-time.

📁 Project Structure
--------------------

*   **app.py**: Contains the code for the _Streamlit web application_.
*   **ML.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook with the machine learning logic, including _preprocessing, model training, and evaluation_.
*   **ML.py**: Script version of the Jupyter notebook for _direct import into the Streamlit app_.
*   **requirements.txt**: Lists all the _Python modules_ required to run the project.
*   **summary.txt**: Provides a _step-by-step summary_ of how the application works.
